# Task 1 - Network Scan

This repository contains the results of a network scan done using **Nmap** on a local subnet.

## Steps Performed
1. Checked Nmap version  
2. Discovered live hosts on the subnet  
3. Scanned common ports (22, 80, 443, 3389)  

## Scan Results
- `hosts_up.txt` → shows all active hosts  
- `quick_ports.txt` → shows open ports and services
